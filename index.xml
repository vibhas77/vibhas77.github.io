      <title>The Hardest Thing Ever</title>

      <description>The hardest thing ever is to never forget your why.
the harder thing is to not get distracted.
Why are you doing what you doing? And for what , for whom.
This is hard. Other noises of your environment will make you move away from that.
Because they don&amp;rsquo;t care for your why.
There is nothing that they will gain from it.

      <title>Doing Things That Matter</title>

      <description>All of us are given approximately the same time.
Then why do some people tend to deliver better results than others?
Simply because they do things that matter the most to them and ignore the rest.
Not everything in life matters equally.
Not every decision matters equally.
To-do list is often a lie. Some tasks areÂ more important than others.</description>

      <title>Focus: X divided by infinity is zero</title>
      <link>http://www.vibhasgoyal.com/posts/focus/</link>

      <description>A small and relatively simple concept that I have learned over the last 2 years is this.
&amp;rdquo; ( X / Infinity ) = Zero &amp;ldquo; This is true in all the cases of real life.
Effort or time divided into many different , unrelated areas of focus would result in a very small output where as concentrated efforts would lead to more and more output.
If a person, puts his effort into many unrelated fields, it leads to a constant state of unhappiness and confusion.</description>
