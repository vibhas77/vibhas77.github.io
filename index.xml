      <title>The Hardest Thing Ever</title>
      <link>http://www.vibhasgoyal.com/posts/the-hardest-thing-ever/</link>

      <guid>http://www.vibhasgoyal.com/posts/the-hardest-thing-ever/</guid>
      <description>The hardest thing ever is to never forget your why.
the harder thing is to not get distracted.
Why are you doing what you doing? And for what , for whom.
This is hard. Other noises of your environment will make you move away from that.
Because they don&amp;rsquo;t care for your why.
There is nothing that they will gain from it.

      <title>Doing Things That Matter</title>

      <description>All of us are given approximately the same time.
Then why do some people tend to deliver better results than others?
Simply because they do things that matter the most to them and ignore the rest.
Not everything in life matters equally.
Not every decision matters equally.
To-do list is often a lie. Some tasks areÂ more important than others.</description>

      <title>Focus: X divided by infinity is zero</title>
      <link>http://www.vibhasgoyal.com/posts/focus/</link>

      <description>A small and relatively simple concept that I have learned over the last 2 years is this.
&amp;rdquo; ( X / Infinity ) = Zero &amp;ldquo; This is true in all the cases of real life.
Effort or time divided into many different , unrelated areas of focus would result in a very small output where as concentrated efforts would lead to more and more output.
If a person, puts his effort into many unrelated fields, it leads to a constant state of unhappiness and confusion.</description>

      <title>Case Studies with the Biz Doc, Mr. Thomas Ellsworth</title>

      <description>Mr. Thomas Ellsworth is awesome.
I love the content that he produces and I eagerly wait every Friday for him to upload his videos on my favourite YouTube channel Valuetainment.
The lessons that one can get from his case studies are extremely helpful.
The whole of Valuetainment is a gold mine for any entrepreneur and would recommend anyone to watch some of their content even if they are not an entrepreneur.</description>

      <title>Business Lesson: Employee Equity</title>
      <link>http://www.vibhasgoyal.com/posts/employee-equity/</link>

      <guid>http://www.vibhasgoyal.com/posts/employee-equity/</guid>
      <description>Business Lesson : Pay equity to employees more than investor.
First of all, I will start that I got to learn many things yesterday about equity.
Investors are important. ( Maybe ) but they are not active in the business.
Hence it makes more sense to pay equity to employees as a startup.
Of-course both investors and employees and all the stakeholders ( shareholders ) must be vested.
Vesting is an important contract.</description>

      <description>Hi, I am Vibhas, studying Engineering Science at IITH ( 2014 batch ). So let me introduce you to our branch.
( I am writing this down here as some of the content on official website has not been updated yet ) Introduction / Course Description Beyond doubt,Â Engineering science is a very special branch in IIT Hyderabad.
No other IIT has it like ours.
Although I am not going to declare it the best branch ever.</description>
