  <p>A business is just like a farm.</p>
<p>Infact farming is a business that is easy for most people to understand.</p>
<p>You have to take care of it everyday.</p>
<p>You have to do the hustle and reach out to your customers.</p>
<p>You need land for your farm ( Initial Investments )</p>
<p>You hire employees to take care of your farm.</p>
<p>You have to regularly water it.</p>
<p>You have to take out the weeds.</p>
<p>You need to know the market demands.</p>
<p>You need to know when it is time to harvest your farm.</p>
<p>You celebrate a good harvest like a festival.</p>
<p>You need to be prepared for emergencies too.</p>
<p>You will sometimes have to bootstrap your own resources and learn to manage your expenses.</p>
<p>You also do side hustle that helps you in farming ( poultry )</p>
<p>You must also be aware of your competition.</p>
<p>You must learn to maintain supplies and cash flow.</p>
<p>Working on your own farm will result in more income than working in other&rsquo;s farm.</p>
<p>You must learn to keep valuable employees employed to your farm.</p>
<p>You must invest in the latest technology to stay ahead.</p>
<p>You may live near your farm to have a better watch over it.</p>
<p>You must buy pesticides, high yielding seeds, machinery for a better produce.</p>
<p>You must also know when to buy these things, for early high investment may lead to lots of debt.</p>
<p>You will have to protect it from wild animals ( the crazy customers ) and learn to deal with them.</p>
<p>For more profits, you must learn to create a brand for your farm.</p>
<p>You can market it like &ldquo;Organic Produce&rdquo; when you are not able to afford pesticides.</p>
<p>Simple marketing strategies like the above would come more naturally to you when you are aware of the marketplace.</p>
<p>At some point, you must start acquiring other farms.</p>
<p>Building value to your customer takes time and effort.</p>
<p>The crops won&rsquo;t grow in a day, no matter how much effort you put into it.</p>
<p>You must become comfortable with uncertainties in your harvest.</p>
<p>You should be educated enough about your farm to know where to grow what seed and how to grow it.</p>
<p>If not experienced, you must not be afraid to seek help or information from other farmers.</p>
<p>If you do finally achieve success, you might help other farmers to achieve it too.</p>
