  <h1>Focus: X divided by infinity is zero</h1>
  <time datetime=2018-03-17T18:10:29&#43;0530 class="post-date">Sat, Mar 17, 2018</time>
  
  <p>A small and relatively simple concept that I have learned over the last 2 years is this.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Effort or time divided into many different , unrelated areas of focus would result in a very small output where as concentrated efforts would lead to more and more output.</p>
<p>If a person, puts his effort into many unrelated fields, it leads to a constant state of unhappiness and confusion.</p>
<p>If a business sells many different varieties of products, it might find difficulty in selling their products under the same brand.</p>
<p>Similarly, if a person consumes various kind of news simultaneously, it leads to zero output or newer forms of understanding.</p>
<p>This is the exact reason why I believe that newspaper and social media overall are of net zero value to the reader if he decides to read all of it.</p>
<p>Too much information could cause confusion?</p>
<p>Learning to extract the kind of information you need is your responsibility.</p>
<p>If you do not decide to choose your own information stream, do expect others to decide it for you ( some kind of silly mainstream media or news ). And it might not be good for you.</p>
<p>Too much information spread over various topics = Zero value.</p>
<p>Deciding on what you want to do is important for the same.</p>
