  <p>Hi, I recently read an article by Shane Parrish of the Farnam Street Blog that mentioned the importance of choosing velocity over speed.</p>
<p>This post actually was a nice idea and I really felt that something more could be learnt from it.</p>
<p>I would highly recommend you to read the article linked below</p>
<p><strong>[Speed vs Velocity] (<a href="https://www.fs.blog/2018/03/speed-velocity/">https://www.fs.blog/2018/03/speed-velocity/</a>)</strong></p>
<p>I have had my own share of personal experience with this analysis of focus and would like to share it.</p>
<p>I am actually someone who is highly obsessed with increasing my efficiency / productivity.</p>
<p>But efficiency can also achieved by doing things in a particular direction rather than trying to do tasks faster.</p>
<p>Think about this: <em><strong>An incremental increase in speed can only be considered useful if it is in a direction that you would like to go.</strong></em></p>
<p>If all the directions are random then what would end up with is zero displacement even if speed of completing tasks was increased.</p>
<p>As a programmer in college, I have various options ahead of me. Even in CSE, there are large number of fields that one can specialise in such as</p>
<ul>
<li>Distributed Computing</li>
<li>Blockchain</li>
<li>Web Development</li>
<li>Deep Learning / Machine learning</li>
<li>Compiler engineering</li>
<li>Operating systems</li>
</ul>
<p>And many such.. It is important to know which fields to choose and be true to it. For me personally, I was initially interested to learn about Machine Learning and did a basic course in it, but after some time I realized that the effort I was putting in learning it was not really focused academically and my grades started to fluctuate as I began to divert from my main hobby / focus within the CSE department. ( Grades can be considered an objective measure in my opinion )</p>
<p>And many times, this selection comes by eliminating the things that you would not like to do or the things that you</p>
<p>[Patrick Bet-David] ( //patrickbetdavid.com ) ( my personal hero ) as often said that successful people / businesses always specialise rather than generalise. The generalised behaviour always come later.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Choose your direction</strong></li>
<li><strong>Learn to say no</strong> : to things that are not aligned with your direction.</li>
<li><strong>Create a systematic approach to saying no</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Thus from now on, I would like to consider this factor while taking any decision worth undertaking and I would like to take it as a challenge for myself to see what can be achieved by doing so.</p>
<p>To requoute from the article :</p>
<blockquote>
<p>‚ÄúPeople think focus means saying yes to the thing you‚Äôve got to focus on. But that‚Äôs not what it means at all. It means saying no to the hundred other good ideas that there are. You have to pick carefully. I‚Äôm actually as proud of the things we haven‚Äôt done as the things I have done. Innovation is saying ‚Äòno‚Äô to 1,000 things.‚Äù</p>
