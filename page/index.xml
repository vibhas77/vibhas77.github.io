      <description>Hi, I am Vigo (Vibhas Goyal).
I am currently studying at IIT Hyderabad, B.Tech in Engineering Science and Computer Science ( 2014 - 2018 ).
This is the about page and for me, this page can be considered as one of the most difficult page to write because it involves writing about my objective self.
Thus I would begin my introduction with some of the facts related to me.
I wish to become an entrepreneur and start my own profitable and scalable business.</description>
